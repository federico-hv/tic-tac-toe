# React Tic Tac ![Toe](https://gdurl.com/JwFD)


Tic Tac Toe built using React leveraging TDD with Jest and Enzyme.


## Description 

This project was built using facebook's [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) which I recommend as a good starting point for all of you who are just giving their first step with [React](https://reactjs.org/) since its very simple to get started and you can just jump into code without any complicated configurations.

The tools I used for the testing part are [Jest](https://reactjs.org/) and [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/).


### Demo: [https://dull-pipe.surge.sh/](https://dull-pipe.surge.sh/)  


### To run this code simply go into the project's folder and run:

```sh
//For development (adding more features)
npm start 

//This starts a development server on port 8000


//For production build
npm run build

//This will create a production build with everything optimized to be served as static files.
```

To serve the demo I used [Surge](https://surge.sh/) which I think is a good option for static websites.


### Next steps

* Make it a Progressive web app following **Create React App** [docs](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app)
* Enable multiplayer using [Google's Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) or a nodejs service using [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)
